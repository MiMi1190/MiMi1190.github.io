<h1>⭐️Zhenzhen's Portfolio⭐️</h1>
<em>⭐️Hi! My name is Zhenzhen, but you can also call me Alice.
I’m an artist who loves to bring my dreams and personal experiences to life through art. I enjoy exploring a wide range of styles and mediums, from traditional oil and acrylic paintings to digital art and sketching. For me, art is more than just creating something visually appealing—it’s about telling a story and giving each piece a deeper meaning. I’m constantly experimenting with new techniques and tools to push the boundaries of my creativity. My goal is to create art that not only captures the eye but also sparks thought and emotion.⭐️</em>
