<em>⭐️My series of images is talking about virtual characters in games. Many people say that virtual characters are just a string of code, but I wonder what it would be like if they had feelings and a sense of self and wanted to break through the limitations of the internet. These glitches could be proof that they want to break through and prove their existence in this world.⭐️</em>
